# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
Problem:
In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.
Objectives:
Explore the Dataset: Uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.
Conduct Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive deep into bivariate relationships against the target.
Preprocessing Steps:
Remove irrelevant features
Address missing values
Treat outliers
Encode categorical variables
Transform skewed features to achieve normal-like distributions
Model Building:
Establish pipelines for models that require scaling
Implement and tune classification models including KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
Emphasize achieving high recall for class 1, ensuring comprehensive identification of heart patients
Evaluate and Compare Model Performance: Utilize precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge models' effectiveness.
